Jack Nicholson and Dyan Cannon never mugged for the cameras at Laker games? Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s roll the tape Everything is by a hair. Toronto tried to give them Game 3. Bucks never won another game. Basketball looked like it was made of Kryptonite. Only Giannis and Brook Lopez wanted the ball  Jump shooter. You gotta go get your offense. I also remember Hammer on the sidelines of Falcons games, Bill Murray always being noticed at Cubs ga\\xe2\\x80\\xa6  In December, yeah.

I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pick anyone. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that in July. I just didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it was a given. I thought Toronto was the favorite.

What they have done this year shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be tarnished by Ka\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 2) Who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming back? How do you keep this team together? Larry immediately said to view this championship as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cti\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 1) This is not a championship, obviously, but it reminds me of 2010 in Arlington, when the Giants beat Texas to win\\xe2\\x80\\xa6  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right.Kawhi lefty dunk on Giannis will not soon be forgotten It is amazing that the Celtics, Raptors and Bucks likely have no idea what their roster will look like.

No one wanted to shoot. No one w\\xe2\\x80\\xa6   Who else would it be?

Well earned.Win two, lose four straight Kawhi Leonard is the absolute business.Ovah  Lowry could have dribbled out the clock he had the ball up top. Milwaukee would have had to foul They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even call it anymoreKhris Middleton has taken one shot in the last 11 minutes and it was a desperation 3 with no time on the clock.Example where refs rely on replay instead of watching the game. And technically, defense cannot put its hand through the twine.How do you blow a call like that? Game should be over.An alley oop is not a signature move Milwaukee doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where it wants to go on the court for offense. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s here where Giannis needs to develop a signature move.Did Giannis touch his own airball first? On the other hand  Nope. And here we goWith a no-show like this, Plan B has gotta be get it to six with five to play and hope Kawhi can get you home.  Maybe no one told her Robert Palmer passed away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd as for you,  I leave the rara avis on the table there, as a little memento.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  I aim to pleaseWhile considering tonight\\xe2\\x80\\x99s game, it struck me that it was only 3 1/2 years ago that the back to back pennant-winni\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 While considering tonight\\xe2\\x80\\x99s game, I harkened back to the 2012 ECF, where the Celtics went home to play Miami up 3-2\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe shortest farewells are best.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d - Kasper Gutman  And where was the gun?

New Orleans is a magical city, full of legends and unexplained phenomena.  Yes,  While reading, I actually googled some of the items you mentioned: the London Hammer, etc. Fasci\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 It could be creepy, right,  Like when Roan bought all of the snow globes so he could \"\"read\"\" Melicent\\'s memo\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Wouldn\\'t we all love to have selective psychometry,  The ability to revisit memories of our own past.\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I imagined an energy exchange.

I\\'m sure there\\'s more to that story   Adding  hashtag to get this comment into the feed. Thanks,   Final question for  What did you learn about yourself while writing WOMEN WARRIORS? Where can people read more about this 3-question history challenge,   You\\'ve made me itchy to know more. I\\'m sure you\\'ll give this forgotten woman a place in history. Because that\\'s you\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Damned if they do and damned if they don\\'t. The    Now that WOMEN WARRIORS is in the hands of readers, what are you working on,  Yes!  Yes, and she is a fairly contemporary example,   We never got into the topic of how women maintained any shape of the feminine while living a warrior lifestyle. Hav\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Which figure in WARRIOR WOMEN inspired you most as a woman in this age of  and   We\\'re running out of time with  and I have a couple more questions. Do you have a few extra minutes, Pam? Ooh sounds like Matilda of Tuscany would make for fascinating historical fiction, then.   Tragic. She could have used her own historian to scribe her story. So glad you\\'ve brought it out in WOMEN WARRIORS.\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Which figure in WOMEN WARRIORS was most challenging to research, understand, write,  I wonder why the female name \"\"Cynane\"\" has never found its way into Western culture, such as other female names as A\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 This is important to understand. Being a warrior isn\\'t only about marching with troops, it\\'s also a mentality again\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Which figure in WOMEN WARRIORS did you find most interesting, astonishing, fascinating,  What a brilliant example of a woman stepping into power for justice and revenge.  Let\\'s talk now about some of the women warriors in your book,  Reading the Greek classics, war was about defending honor, achieving glory and immortality. How does this compare t\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 It comes down to women answering the call to defend what they love.   Let\\'s talk about some of those ways women fought outside the regular army.  can you give some examples?\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Women were given away as chattel in marriage, so in one way this was not cruelty, but another type of patriarchal h\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Do you mean as regional alliances were made and tribes formed into countries, governed by a central figure,\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Wow. How little credit they\\'ve received. How did their campaigns compare to those of all-male units,  What happened in history to change the view of women as warriors, defending their clan, tribe, etc,  Maybe a little bit of white privilege, eh   Regarding the women who fought, were they part of a regular army, conscripted just like men were,   We are chatting right now with historian &amp; author  about her new book WOMEN WARRIORS. Certainly, it had to be more than just someone needed to stay home with the babies, right?  Legends abound of the Greeks, Athena, and other goddesses, in war. Why do you think females were held back from fig\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Yes, those pesky hyphens can really make a difference in armed-ness!   Yes, it is a fabulous way to begin  Thank you,   In your research, did any cultures of the past openly allow female warriors alongside male,  That\\'s a fascinating way of seeing this transition. Those who attend the war-wounded to those who inflict the wound\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Why not? Writing history for non-historians is your superpower,   When did the idea for WARRIOR WOMEN fall upon you,  I\\'m so excited to have you back,  .

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be 1 vote each all roun\\xe2\\x80\\xa6  yes, apparently there are others - I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t explored those. did they seriously answer questions, though? Or just trot out slightly more obfuscated lies? Those\\xe2\\x80\\xa6  some things don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change. But they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so great, aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they. Which are you on?Worst.

That really disto\\xe2\\x80\\xa6  nah, he really hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBrexit. If not that, GE. If not that, confirmatory vote.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In that or\\xe2\\x80\\xa6  no SNP? They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take over Scotland.

That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the essential flaw in tryi\\xe2\\x80\\xa6   yes, but for that duo to think they had the expertise or knowledge to decide we HAD\\xe2\\x80\\xa6    if a human has to assist it, then it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t autonomous.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAutonomous data is e\\xe2\\x80\\xa6   they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t participate in the California DMV stats so hard to tell.
